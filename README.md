# GreenSignal
## An encrypted secure chat server written in Python

## About
GreenSignal is a secure chat server which uses AES and RSA as it's main encryption protocols. You'll need Python3 and some libraries to run the program, but encryption protocols are prebuilt and implemented. Some options, such as server ip and port, user limit and server's "Secret Key" need to be changed manually inside the code, you will easily find them on the very first lines of the code, right after importing required libraries. Enjoy!

## Getting Started
### Run the server:
```python3 Server.py```
### Connect as a client:
```python3 Client.py```
