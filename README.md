# GreenSignal
## A secure server-client messenger over the network

## About
GreenSignal is a secure chat server which uses AES and RSA as it's main encryption protocols. You'll need Python3 and a few third-party libraries to run the program, but encryption protocols are prebuilt and implemented. Some options, such as server's ip and port, user limit and server's "Secret Key" are hard-coded into the program and need to be changed manually inside the code, you will easily find them near the top of the program. Enjoy!

## Getting Started
### Run the server:
```python3 Server.py```
### Connect as a client:
```python3 Client.py```
